> "Data is no longer a record of the past. It is the engine that drives the real world."

This is an open-source book project that demystifies "Ontology," the core concept of Palantir, 
the world's most powerful data platform, not merely as an IT technology,
but as an "operational foundation that shapes organizational decision-making and the future of AI."
To bridge the deep chasm between the forefront of engineering and the philosophy of business management,
we have systematized facts and architectural structures based on primary sources.

## 🏛️ Core Tenets (Three Philosophies Piercing Through Ontology)

While traditional data infrastructure (Data Lakes and DWHs) falls into the trap of being a "swamp of dead data just for viewing," the paradigm shift presented by Palantir is based on the following principles:

1. **The Operational Layer**
   Data is not meant for humans to manually drive reality at the end of analysis. Ontology is a "digital twin" that reproduces real business on the system, becoming a layer where data itself directly drives the business.
2. **Convergence of Noun and Verb**
   The system is captured as an integration of "objects (nouns)" and "actions (verbs)." It encapsulates not only states (semantics) like customers and parts, but also kinetic elements like ordering and status changes into a single model.
3. **Governance of Reality**
   The immense power to rewrite real-world operations requires absolute control. Even in an era where AI makes autonomous proposals, ontology balances overwhelming speed and governance through "branches" and "reviews."
